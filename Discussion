Hey team. Since Yicheng has done the checkpoint, I can take his spot to work on the diskspace 
if no one has been working on it already. - Raymond

Hey team. Can someone commit the information you learned from the meeting today?

Just updated the diskspace. Does anyone have any questions about how to use it?
-Raymond

Does anyone understand why we have to drop the line "ArrayList<String> Identifiers"
in Node?
-Raymond

The second element of the Node needs to be an integer that represents the starting 
point for the valueStorage to start writing.
-Justin

So is the node class ready now or do we still have to modify it somehow?

For Raymond -
In the read() method in the diskspace class the area number given to 
disk.seek should be multiplied by 1024 (should probably create a global 
constant in the diskspace class for the block size). And disk.readByte() should
be changed to disk.read(byte[] b) or disk.readFully(byte[] b). I'm not sure which
method should be used. In the write method, the area number should also be multiplied
by the block size when using the seek() method.
