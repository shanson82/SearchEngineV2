Hey team. Since Yicheng has done the checkpoint, I can take his spot to work on the diskspace 
if no one has been working on it already. - Raymond

Hey team. Can someone commit the information you learned from the meeting today?

Just updated the diskspace. Does anyone have any questions about how to use it?
