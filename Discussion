Hey team. Since Yicheng has done the checkpoint, I can take his spot to work on the diskspace 
if no one has been working on it already. - Raymond

Hey team. Can someone commit the information you learned from the meeting today?

Just updated the diskspace. Does anyone have any questions about how to use it?
-Raymond

Does anyone understand why we have to drop the line "ArrayList<String> Identifiers"
in Node?
-Raymond

The second element of the Node needs to be an integer that represents the starting 
point for the valueStorage to start writing.
-Justin

So is the node class ready now or do we still have to modify it somehow?
