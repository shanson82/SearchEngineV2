11/4 Comment by Ted Herman -
Would be good to know the names of the files and classes
that each person will be working on, so as to better 
track the git updates.  Also, the .project file was 
not checked in (do "git add .project") so that a git clone
or git pull will have what's needed for Eclipse to import
the repository.
