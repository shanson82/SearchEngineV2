11/4 Comment by Ted Herman -
Would be good to know the names of the files and classes
that each person will be working on, so as to better 
track the git updates.  Also, the .project file was 
not checked in (do "git add .project") so that a git clone
or git pull will have what's needed for Eclipse to import
the repository.


11/6 Update
.project file was added to the repository
Each member has a class that they are primarily responsible for, but all members are helping each other as needed to keep moving forward. 
Checkpoint - Yicheng
Allocate - Steve
Diskspace - Raymond
KeyStorage - Justin
ValueStorage - Will

11/12 Update
Justin, Will, Steve, and Raymmond met.  Steve and Justin refined Diskspace, keyStorage, and Allocate to help with functionality and 
eliminate some errors.  Raymmond and Will worked on valueStorage.  At this point we need to finish ValueStorage and
work on unit tests and integration tests.
