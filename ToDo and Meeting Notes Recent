Team 6 To do:

Tasks for the next week:
Perform more research to understand problem (all)
Write unit tests and complete Checkpoint class (Ray)
Get Disk Space class implemented (Yicheng and Justin)
Research linked list implementations in Java (Will)
Create a working linked list (Will)
Complete Allocate class with unit tests (Steve)

Following tasks are not divided among group members yet
Start Key storage and Value storage 
Work on Node class

11/4 Comment by Ted Herman -
Would be good to know the names of the files and classes
that each person will be working on, so as to better 
track the git updates.  Also, the .project file was 
not checked in (do "git add .project") so that a git clone
or git pull will have what's needed for Eclipse to import
the repository.

11/5 Update
Steve, Justin, and Will met with Professor Herman to help better understand the diskspace structure and value/keystorage.
Then met in Linux lab to integrate structure into our code.

11/6 Update
.project file was added to the repository
Each member has a class that they are primarily responsible for, but all members are helping each other as needed to keep moving forward. 
Checkpoint - Yicheng
Allocate - Steve
Diskspace - Raymond
KeyStorage - Justin
ValueStorage - Will

11/11 Update
Will and Steve met and worked on valueStorage

11/12 Update
Justin, Will, Steve, and Raymmond met.  Steve and Justin refined Diskspace, keyStorage, and Allocate to help with functionality and 
eliminate some errors.  Raymmond and Will worked on valueStorage.  At this point we need to finish ValueStorage and
work on unit tests and integration tests.

11/14 Update
Steve and Will met in the morning.  Went through and made lists of methods and interaction of entire program.  Made
comment about redesign.

Justin, Will, Steve, and Raymmond met during discussion hour.  Implemented new Node objects for both valueStorage and 
keyStorage.  

Steve and Will continued to work after discussion hour.  Met with Professor Herman and discussed ramifications of new 
valueStorage and keyStorage on possible unit tests.  He was okay with it.

Will and Justin met in the afternoon.  Worked on documentation of the process.
